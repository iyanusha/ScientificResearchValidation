A decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain for validating scientific research through transparent peer review and replication tracking. This platform leverages Bitcoin's security and immutability through Stacks to ensure the integrity of scientific research validation.

## Overview

The Scientific Research Validation Platform revolutionizes the scientific research validation process by:
- Providing immutable timestamping of research submissions
- Managing transparent peer review processes
- Tracking experiment replications
- Ensuring data integrity through blockchain technology
- Leveraging Bitcoin's security through Stacks

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Research Submission**: Secure submission of research data with IPFS integration
- **Peer Review Management**: Transparent tracking of peer reviews and reviewer credentials
- **Replication Tracking**: Verification of experiment replication attempts
- **Timestamping**: Immutable proof of submission timing
- **Data Integrity**: Blockchain-based verification of research data

### Technical Features
- Smart contracts written in Clarity
- Integration with IPFS for data storage
- Bitcoin-anchored security through Stacks
- Automated validation processes
- Transparent reputation system

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- Research submission contract
- Peer review management
- Replication tracking
- Reputation system
- Incentive mechanisms

### Storage
- On-chain: Metadata, validation status, and reputation scores
- Off-chain: Research data (IPFS)
- Bitcoin anchoring: Timestamps and security

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet
- Node.js environment
- IPFS node (optional for development)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iyanusha/ScientificResearchValidation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Start local Stacks blockchain
clarinet integrate

# Deploy contracts
clarinet deploy
```

## Usage

### For Researchers
1. Submit research with methodology
2. Monitor peer review process
3. Track replication attempts
4. Receive validation status

### For Reviewers
1. Register as a peer reviewer
2. Submit credentials
3. Review research submissions
4. Provide verification

### For Replicators
1. Access methodology
2. Submit replication attempts
3. Document variations
4. Report results

## Smart Contract Interface

### Key Functions
- `submit-research`: Submit new research for validation
- `submit-peer-review`: Submit a peer review
